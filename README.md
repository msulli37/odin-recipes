This website will provide me the ability to practice setting up different pages, and adding content
to said pages. 

The homepage will contain hypertext links to other html files, which will have recipe infomation displayed. These recipe pages will display images of the foods, descriptions, unordered and ordered lists, and other basic HTML elements. 

This project also provides a good opportunity to get used to working with git. I want to use this simple project to build a habit of making atomic commits, and getting more familiar with github.
