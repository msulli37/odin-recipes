    <h4>It doesn't get <strong>easier</strong> than egg rice! And it's quite <strong>delicious</strong></h4>
    <p>
        Egg rice is another quick meal that can function as a breakfast, lunch, snack, or even as a part of a dinner!
        It takes less than 5 minutes to make, and with the right combination of ingredients tastes amazing. It's can be a good pick me up
        when you don't have the energy to make something more demanding, or maybe just a side to a larger meal. A simple meal makes a 
        versatile meal, so having this in your recipe book will help you out eventually!
