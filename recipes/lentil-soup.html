        Lentil soup is an <strong>easy, healthy, and delicious option</strong> for anyone looking to make a meal 
        for multiple people, or maybe to meal prep for a busy week to come. I personally love making lentil 
        soup because it gives me energy during my week, and I enjoy experiementing with various spices to
        create a unique flavor each time I make it. I hope that in sharing my recipe with y'all that more
        people grow to love this dish!
