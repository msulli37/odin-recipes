    <h4>BECs are a classic breakfast sandwich!</h4>
    <p>
        Bacon Egg and Cheese (<strong>BEC</strong>, for short) are an easy breakfast sandwich to make, and -with the right technique-
        can create a saucy and crunchy amalgamation of the short list of ingredients. When I started making these, I quickly found myself
        making them everyday!
